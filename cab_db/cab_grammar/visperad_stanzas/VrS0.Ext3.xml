                <ab class="ab_indent">"then if the Visperad of Gāhānbār is to be performed, he recites 4 Ahuna Vairiia, (and if) the Visperad of Navar and (Visperad of) Geti Kharīd is
                    to be performed, (he recites) 10 (Ahuna Vairiia). After that the chief priest taking the jug which has been made pure, in his right hand, purifies the fire-stand
                    as per the rule; then coming near the seat, climbs upon the seat while reciting 2 Ahuna Vairiia. And the assistant priest, if he has stepped down from the seat
                    (and) released the bāj, (and) is standing outside the pāvī , then taking the bāj, he comes back inside the pāvī of the table (and) recites as many Ahuna Vairiia as
                    have been recited by the chief priest. Then both of them remember together in a low tone: <em>humata hūxta huuaršta humanašnw hugauuašnw hukunašnə īn xšnumaine</em>.
                    Recite here the dedication for which Visperad is to be performed."</ab>
