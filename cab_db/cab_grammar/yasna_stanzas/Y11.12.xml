            <ab class="ab_indent">"The chief priest, taking that <em>hom</em> cup in the hand, releases the <em>bāj</em> alone.
               While reciting the first of the four <em>Aṣ̌əm Vohū</em>, he pours one driblet of water on the place of that cup itself; while reciting the second, he pours one driblet
               near the base of the moon-shaped stand near to him; while reciting the third, he pours (the water) near the base of the moon-shaped stand towards the fire;
               and while reciting the fourth, he pours all the water from that cup near the cup with the bull’s hair (ring). Then he inverts that cup, (held) in the hand,
               near the milk saucer, (which is) near the moon-shaped stand towards the fire plate. The assistant priest sets two (pieces of) wood (and) incense on the two stones."</ab></ab>
