# Corpus Avesticum Berolinense (CAB)

The CAB project (Corpus Avesticum Berolinense), carried out at the Institute of Iranian Studies of the Freie Universität Berlin, represents the first attempt to edit the entire Avestan Zoroastrian textual corpus within its ritual context, and to produce and offer both printed and digital editions of the texts.

CAB provides a wide set of tools, amongst which:
1. a ceremony generator: a tool that will allow the user to automatically create a ritual within a specific context (part of the day, date, divinity to which the ceremony is addressed, festivity, etc.).
1. a manuscript transliteration viewer
1. a dynamic database of Avestan manuscripts
1. an implementation of Bartholomae’s Altiranisches Wörterbuch

CAB runs on the eXist-db project and is compatible with versions 6.0.0 and above.

Place the **cab**, **cab_db**, and **cab_manuscripts** folders inside /db/apps/.  **cab** can also be archived and installed as a *.xar* app.

The index folders need to go into /db/system/config/db/
