                    <p class="news_paragraph">In the second phase of the funding, the analysis of the information contained in the Pahlavi

literature will be carried out. The aim is to collect all mentions of the rituals in the Avestan

language in the extant Middle Persian literature, with a twofold intention:
<br/>
1. to analyze the view of the liturgies transmitted through the Middle Persian literature and to

collect information on their performance;
<br/>
2. to collect the citations of the Avestan liturgical texts in Middle Persian literature.
<br/>
                            <br/>
The search will cover the complete Middle Persian literature (epigraphic and book-Pahlavi) with special attention to the meta-ritual literature. The latter will include not only the Hērbadestān and Nērangestān, but also the lesser-known additional meta-ritual literature (e.g. the 31 Questions on the Drōn) or the unedited texts (e.g. the Nērang ī Āb, the description of the Nōg-Nāwar, etc.). In addition, all Middle Persian literature will be read and information will be sought on the rituals and their performance up to the end of Late Antiquity.

                    <p class="news_paragraph">Since the announcement last week of the news concerning CAB1.1 when the publication of the Pahlavi ritual instructions of the Yasna was advertised, the ritual instructions of the Yasn ī Rapihwin (after the ms. 0300) and of the Visperad (after the nice ms. 2109 and for the last part of ms. 2030) have now been published. The ritual instructions for the performance of the Videvdad and Vištāsp Yašt will follow in short.
The transliteration and translation will be incorporated for the launch of CAB1.2, likely by the end of April 2019.

                    A new version of CAB (CAB1.1) is released. It incorporates many new features. The most
important ones are summarized below. They have grouped under following categories:

                    <b>Ceremonies</b>
                            <br/>
                    The ceremonies that are now available are all types of the Long Liturgy attested in the
Iranian manuscripts of the 17th Century with all the performative variants described in the
manuscripts available in the manuscripts and the Rivāyats (different dedicatories, especial
celebrations during the Gāhānbārs or the last ten days of the year, etc.)
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yasna</li>
                        <li>Visperad</li>
                        <li>Vidēvdād</li>
                        <li>Vištāsp Yašt</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="news_paragraph">
Furthermore, the closely related Drōn Yašt is also available. The ceremonies can be seen
stanza by stanza or complete and in transcription or in Avestan script.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news_paragraph">
A further new feature is the possibility of compare to ceremonies using the button “View
parallel ceremonies”. In next future parallel stanzas will be arranged automatically together,
but for the moment a manual comparison is possible. See e.g. the comparison can be done
stanza by stanza or viewing the complete ceremony (using the button “View all stanzas in
parallels”). Here a screenshot of the comparison of the beginning of the Drōn Yašt with Y3.1
in which the similitudes and differences appear clearly:

will be made available in next future. The standard nērangs included are based mainly in the
manuscripts mss. 40 and 400 that offer the best nērangs for the Yasna. In a future, the user
will be able to decide from which manuscript the nerangs should be displayed.

                    In the stanza information, a very restrictive apparatus is presented. It contains only real
variant that could be meaningful for the text understanding or orthographical variants that
are unusual and could therefore be relevant. In the future, this apparatus will be substituted
by an apparatus produced by Collate.

                    The first steps have been done towards an automatically generated apparatus on the basis of
the transcriptions of the manuscripts produced in our project. Our transliteration system has
been adapted in order to be able to use Collate. In the future, the tool will be integrated in CAB. For the moment, here is a screenshot of the apparatus of Y1.15c generated based on a
small sample of six manuscripts:

                    <p class="news_paragraph">
                   Before the end of the month, the Corpus Avesticum Berolinense (CAB) will launch the first version of its online edition (CAB 1.0). It is the first step of this longterm project that intends to publish all rituals in the Avestan language in the next 12 years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news_paragraph">
CAB 1.0 includes a ceremony generator that allows each ritual in the Avestan language to be generated as it is celebrated on a chosen date and with each possible dedicatory. Thus, the variability of the Avestan texts in their ritual performance will be conveniently represented for the first time. The presented liturgical system is based on the oldest Iranian Avestan manuscripts, but a similar system was operating already in Sasanian times, as we know from the Nērangestān, and was probably already constituted in Achaemenid times.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news_paragraph">
In order to make possible an analysis of the variability in the different version of each ceremony and of the ceremonies as such, CAB 1.0 also offers the possibility to compare different ceremonies or performance of two ceremonies in different days or with different dedicatories.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news_paragraph">
It displays the text in transliteration in Latin characters and also in the Avestan script according to the choice of the user. Both representations can be seen in parallel as well. Here are a few screenshots:
